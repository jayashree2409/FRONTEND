# COUNTERAPP
* DESCRIPTION:* This project is a simple Counter Application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
It demonstrates the concept of Basic DOM Manipulation â€” updating webpage elements dynamically using JavaScript.
Users can increment, decrement, or reset the counter, and the current count is updated in real time without reloading the page.
